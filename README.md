# learn

I will be recording here artifacts produced during my learning endeavors starting with my attempts to the exercises in Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra and Learning from Data. The complete solutions to Chapter 1 are available from the author with selected solutions from later chapters. I'm hoping to compile a complete set of solutions while working through this text.
